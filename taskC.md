**Preparation:**

1. **Assessment and Planning:**
    
    - **Inventory and Analysis:** Meticulously document all resources within task groups A & B on your existing platform. This includes:
        - Virtual machines (VMs) - specifications, operating system, applications installed.
        - Database details - type (e.g., MySQL), size, security configurations.
        - Storage - type (e.g., S3 buckets), data volume, access controls.
        - Network configurations - VPC structure, security groups, routing rules.
    - **Migration Strategy:** Define the optimal migration approach for each component based on complexity and downtime tolerance. Consider factors like:
        - **Database:** Utilize Azure Database Migration Service for minimal downtime database transfers.
        - **Application:** Evaluate containerization (Docker) or direct code/binary deployment for efficient application migration.
        - **Storage:** Leverage Azure Data Factory or AzCopy tool for bulk data transfer of application assets (images, PDFs).
    - **Cost Optimization:** Analyze your resource usage patterns and explore Azure's pricing models (pay-as-you-go, reserved instances) to identify the most cost-effective options.
2. **Azure Environment Setup:**
    
    - Establish a new Azure resource group to organize the migrated resources.
    - Design a Virtual Network (VNet) mirroring the structure and security groups of your existing VPC, ensuring network familiarity for your application.

**Migration Process:**

1. **Database Migration:**
    
    - Utilize Azure Database Migration Service to seamlessly migrate your existing database to a managed Azure Database for MySQL service. This minimizes downtime by replicating data continuously with minimal disruption to your application.
2. **Application Migration:**
    
    - **Containerized Approach (Preferred):**
        - If applicable, containerize your application using Docker. This promotes efficient deployments and simplifies management across cloud environments.
        - Develop Docker images for your application and push them to an Azure Container Registry (ACR).
        - Within your Terraform configuration (if using) or through Azure portal deployment templates, use the `azurerm_container_instance` resource to deploy containerized applications onto Azure VMs.
    - **Direct Deployment:**
        - If containerization is not feasible, migrate your application code (source code or compiled binaries) to the Azure VMs provisioned for your application tier.
        - Utilize tools like `azurerm_remote_exec` provisioner in Terraform (or Azure portal deployment scripts) to automate software installations (e.g., PHP, Laravel, Apache) during VM provisioning.
3. **Storage Migration:**
    
    - Utilize Azure Data Factory, a cloud-based ETL/ELT (Extract, Transform, Load/Extract, Load, Transform) service, for efficient data transfer of application assets (product images, PDFs, etc.). This service offers various data connectors and transformation capabilities, allowing for flexible data migration.
    - Alternatively, leverage the AzCopy tool for bulk data transfer of large datasets from your existing storage to Azure Blob Storage, a highly scalable and cost-effective object storage solution.

**Testing and Cutover:**

1. **Rigorous Testing:**
    
    - Prior to switching traffic, meticulously test all functionalities of the migrated application in the Azure environment. This includes integration testing with the migrated database and ensuring proper functionality of all application components.
2. **Traffic Cutover:**
    
    - Depending on your chosen deployment strategy:
        - **Containerized Applications:** Utilize Azure App Service deployment slots for a seamless traffic shift from the existing environment to the migrated application in Azure. This approach allows for side-by-side testing and minimizes downtime during cutover.
        - **Direct Deployment:** Consider implementing Azure Traffic Manager to gradually route traffic from the existing environment to the migrated application in Azure. This enables a controlled traffic shift and minimizes downtime.
